# Reinforcement Learning (RL)

I'm currently reading the 2nd edition of [Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~sutton/book/the-book.html) and am watching the videos of [David Silver's class on RL](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/d.silver/web/Teaching.html).
I figured it would be a good idea to implement the algorithms and play a little bit with them. For the first chapter this turned out to be a lot of fun :)
